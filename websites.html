  <flashintro>
   Over the course of my time at university I have learned how to design websites using HTML5 and CSS3. I design this site that you're viewing this on. I have also designed other sites that I will list below.

      <h1>Four Walls</h1>
	Four Walls is a series of Comedy shorts made for the Channel 4 Comedy Blaps brief. It features Will, a man who finds that his walls can talk and develops a relationship with him. I designed this site based on a basic bootstrap layout and added to it from there. The site is actually very reponsive and views well on smaller displays such as mobiles or tablets.
