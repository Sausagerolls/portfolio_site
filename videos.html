	For all of my videos, click on the image to the left. This will take you to my You Tube Channel. I only have a few videos up there, but as I make more I will be updating this this page to reflect that.

<h1>Kinetic Typography</h1>
As part of a University project we were tasked with creating an animated typography of a piece of speech that we could choose. I decided on a famous quote from the astrophysicist Carl Sagan. The effect I was going for in this video was make it seem as if the user was lying through the emptiness of space, untill finally zooming in on a video of a rotating Earth, that I made in Blender. I used After Effects to achieve thus result and I think managed to achieve the effect that I was going for.

<h1>Muzzle Flash</h1>
This is an experiment from when I was playing around with Adobe After Effects. I used a muzzle flash image and flashing effects coupled with a gunshot sound to achieve this look.
